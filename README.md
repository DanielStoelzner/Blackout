# Blackout
A small tool to quickly blackout all but the current active screen (the screen where the mouse in on)

You can 
- run the *.ps1 (but you will see a terminal window on Screen 1)
- run the *.vbs
- run the *.exe
- run build.bat to convert the powershell-script to a new *.exe after you made any changes (requires Invoke-ps2exe)

Put a shortcut to the *.exe or *.vbs in "C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu" and pin it to you start menu for quick invocation.
